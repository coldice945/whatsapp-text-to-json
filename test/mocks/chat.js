[13/03/2015, 09:45:52] ‎Neil added you
[13/03/2015, 09:47:32] Neil: Hello all. Have any of you made any plans for Lou's wedding? Are you going? I am trying to work out the best way to get to and from there and what else I might do while I am there. 
Also, are we going to mum's on mothers day?
[13/03/2015, 10:22:39] Rich Williams: Blimey you're on whatsapp!
[13/03/2015, 10:23:09] Rich Williams: I'm driving down in the morning/afternoon on Sunday probably
[13/03/2015, 10:23:38] Rich Williams: I haven't booked my flights for Canada yet but had a look, will be coming back on the Sunday
[13/03/2015, 10:24:34] Rich Williams: I don't have any set plans yet, will do a skydive with Lou I think
[13/03/2015, 11:17:29] Neil: I have on this for years, but just not with both of you. I just don't seem to be able to iMessage Ben very well so thought that I should try this instead.
So u won't be in Canada for long? Perhaps we can talk about it when we go to mums.
[13/03/2015, 11:19:51] Rich Williams: I'd probably like to do 4 or 5 days if I can, I can't really stay out there too long
[14/03/2015, 18:30:15] Ben: I haven't made any plans but doubt I'll go - we've planned a lot of holidays already this year
[18/03/2015, 11:35:56] Rich Williams: Just to confirm... We're going up to Hereford in the 2nd week of April yes?
[18/03/2015, 13:39:57] Neil: I am fine with that.
[18/03/2015, 22:47:34] Ben: Ok. Neil, will you confirm with Nini?
[07/04/2015, 14:04:46] Rich Williams: Has anyone let Nini know we're down this weekend btw?
[07/04/2015, 14:05:40] Neil: Yes. She knows and is fine with it
[07/04/2015, 14:05:50] Rich Williams: Cool
[07/04/2015, 20:28:22] Ben: Need to take sleeping bags
[07/04/2015, 22:05:59] Rich Williams: Cool will bring one along
[07/04/2015, 22:09:42] Neil: Where would you like me to be for pick up?
[07/04/2015, 22:18:39] Ben: What are the options?
[08/04/2015, 09:14:33] Neil: Err. Bethersden or Ashford would be best for me so I can leave my car somewhere safe.
[08/04/2015, 09:45:55] Ben: Ashford would be easier if poss? If you are able to grab the bits needed from Dad's
[08/04/2015, 10:49:34] Neil: I can get them this week. What do I need from there? Anything other than what he gives me?
[08/04/2015, 11:25:29] Ben: Not that I can think of
[08/04/2015, 11:25:32] Ben: Thank you
[09/04/2015, 16:26:38] Neil: Richard, do you have my sleeping bag?
[09/04/2015, 16:27:00] Rich Williams: Yes I do
[09/04/2015, 16:27:45] Rich Williams: Don't suppose my old one is at Dad's is it?
[09/04/2015, 16:28:07] Neil: The coloured ones you mean?
[09/04/2015, 16:28:22] Rich Williams: Yeh the stripey jobs
[09/04/2015, 16:28:31] Rich Williams: 90s looking
[09/04/2015, 16:28:44] Neil: Yes. I shall pick that up and bring it if you could bring mine please
